Ergonomics in workstations is about designing environments that enhance comfort and efficiency, reducing physical strain and improving overall well-being of the users. In this project, you'll use Virtual Reality to provide users with real-time feedback on their posture, helping them make immediate adjustments for better ergonomics.
You will perform motion capture (Mocap) using Vive trackers to record and analyze user movements. This data will be processed to track userâ€™s posture and identify any ergonomic issues.  Inverse kinematic (IK) will be applied in real time to create and display a virtual avatar in Unity that reflects the user's actual posture. The VR environment will also show real-time ergonomics metrics, offering visual feedback and helping users fine-tune their positions for maximum comfort and efficiency.
