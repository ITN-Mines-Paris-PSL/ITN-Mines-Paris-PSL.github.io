From an external viewpoint, time is an immutable physical construct. Yet, from a human internal perspective, our perception of time is quite malleable. Research, backed by numerous peer-reviewed studies, suggests that our internal perception of time can be influenced by a variety of factors. These include pathologies, the use of certain drugs, our emotional state, and cognitive load.
In this project, our goal is to explore this concept further. The objective is to create a Virtual Reality (VR) experiment to examine whether the density of visual input can alter a personâ€™s perception of time. We will also compare these altered perceptions with the actual passage of time to gauge the degree of their deviation.
